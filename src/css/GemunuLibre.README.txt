Gemunu Libre by Google Fonts
============================

About
=====

Gemunu Libre is the Unicode compliant version of the popular Sinhala typeface ‘FM Gemunu’ and includes Latin support as well. This font family has been improved in many ways over FM Gemunu during the Unicode adaptation process by acquiring more breathing space, bigger counters and smooth uniformity in curves.

What sets Gemunu Libre apart from all the other Sinhala typefaces currently in use is the distinctive smooth and square edge, which was perfected whilst completely redrawing the set of characters in order to cater to the requirements of web and screens. Gemunu Libre comes in 7 weights from Extra Light to Extra Bold, and each weight contains the complete Sinhala script and a matching Latin characters.

The project is led by Mooniak in collaboration with Pushpananda Ekanayake. Latin set is designed by Sol Matas. Initial development and release was funded by Google Fonts in 2015. Project sources are hosted and developed on Github and Mooniak welcomes suggestions and contributions to the development.
